- 👋 Hi, I’m @T-Al-D.
- 👀 I’m interested in all sorts of Coding (C/C++, Java, SQL, Python....) and Elektronics (Rasberry, Aduino ...).
- 🌱 I started coding in 09/2019. I already have tried (or experimented with) a few programming-languages, most often I use Python or C# in Visual Studio (Code).
- :blue_book: currently learning ....
- ✨ For the future I want to fill my repository with more "Mini-Projects" as I discover more and more of the amazing and diverse world of Software.

- ⚠️ NONE OF MY PROJECTS HAVE GUARANTEE OR LIABILITY ⚠️
