- 👋 Hi, I’m @T-Al-D.
- 👀 I’m interested in all sorts of Coding (C/C++, Java, SQL, Python....).
- 🌱 I started coding in 09/2019. I already have tried (or experimented with) SQL, Java, Python and C/C++, therefore I’m currently learning JavaScript (for my next Mini-Project!). The IDE´s I have worked with so far: MySQL, IntelliJ IDEA(Community), PyCharm (Community), Eclipse, VisualStudio(2019) and Visual Studio Code.
- ✨ For the future I want to fill my repository with more "Mini-Projects" as I discover more and more of the amazing and diverse world of Software.

- ⚠️ NONE OF MY PROJECTS HAS GUARANTEE OR LIABILITY ⚠️
