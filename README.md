- 👋 Hi, I’m @T-Al-D.
- 👀 I’m interested in all sorts of Coding (C/C++, Java, SQL, Python....) and sometimes Elektronics (Rasberry, Aduino ...).
- 🌱 I've tried (or experimented with) a few programming languages, however most often I use Python (Visual Studio Code) or C# (Visual Studio).
- :blue_book: Currently I´m in an apprenticeship to become an IT-specialist (application development)
- ✨ In the future, I would like to fill my repository with more “mini-projects” as I discover more and more of the amazing and diverse world of software.
